# SDM:
# This program is a simple Pet Store program.
# It lets the user add (register) new pets, view pets, adopt pets, rename pets, and remove (deregister) pets.
# Each pet is a Pet object with a name, species, age, and adopted status.
# All pets are stored in a dictionary with a unique ID for easy access.
# The user can interact with the program through a simple text menu.
